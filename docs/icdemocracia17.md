## Developed Features

* Created a special section for GeoShape configuration in map question edit form.
* A responsive, easy flow using bootstrap 4.0 and Font Awesome 4.7 front-end frameworks survey template that it will be the GAUPsurvey default template.
* Created a plotted map to see all the responses of all survey map questions, that it is possible to active/deactive a question responses map layer.
